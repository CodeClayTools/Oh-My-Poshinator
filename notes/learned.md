# What We Learned

## Project Initialization – What We Learned

**Date:** 2024-03-19  
**Status:** ✅ Success

### 🔍 Summary
Initial project structure and documentation setup for Oh-My-Poshinator, an Electron-based theme editor for Oh-My-Posh.

### 📘 Insight
- The project requires a clear separation between documentation, attempts, and implementation
- Following the `.cursorrules` structure helps maintain organized development
- The project combines multiple technologies (Electron, React, Tailwind, xterm.js) that need careful integration

### 🧠 Takeaway
> A well-structured documentation system is crucial for maintaining clarity in a complex, multi-technology project. The separation of concerns between documentation, attempts, and implementation helps track progress and learnings effectively. 

## ✅ Schema & Validator Integration – What We Learned

**Date:** 2024-05-24  
**Status:** ✅ Success

### 🔍 Summary
- Integrated a JSON Schema-based validator for Oh-My-Posh themes.
- Successfully validated all official themes, confirming schema compatibility.
- Validator flags only intentionally invalid test fixtures, ensuring robust error detection.

### 📘 Insights
- Real-world theme files are a critical resource for schema validation and refinement.
- Schema-driven validation ensures future-proofing as Oh-My-Posh evolves.
- Writing results to a file (`validation-report.txt`) is essential for handling large validation sets and avoiding terminal buffer issues.
- The validator can be used as a CI step to guarantee theme quality for contributors.

### 🧠 Takeaways
> Automated schema validation is a powerful tool for maintaining theme quality and compatibility. Integrating real-world examples and writing results to a file ensures both accuracy and usability, especially at scale. This approach should be standard for any extensible configuration-driven project.
