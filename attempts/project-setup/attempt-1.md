## Attempt #1 â€“ Project Structure and Documentation Setup

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Establish the initial project structure and documentation system following the `.cursorrules` guidelines.

### ðŸ§  Reasoning
Before diving into implementation, we need a solid foundation for tracking progress, documenting decisions, and maintaining a clear development workflow. This follows the "Pre-Work Sanity Checks" principle from our `.cursorrules`.

### ðŸ’¥ Outcome
Successfully created:
- `/notes/learned.md` for tracking project learnings
- `/notes/todo.md` for maintaining task backlog
- Initial documentation structure following `.cursorrules` guidelines

### ðŸ“˜ What We Learned
- The project requires careful consideration of multiple technologies and their integration
- Documentation structure helps maintain clarity in a complex project
- Clear separation between documentation, attempts, and implementation is crucial
- Initial task backlog reveals the complexity of the project and helps prioritize work
