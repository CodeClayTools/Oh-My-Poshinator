General
Oh My Posh renders your prompt based on the definition of blocks (like Lego) which contain one or more segments. A really simple configuration could look like this. The default format is json, but we also support toml and yaml. There's a schema available which is kept up-to-date and helps with autocomplete and validation of the configuration.

info
There are a few themes available which are basically predefined configurations. You can use these as they are, or as a starting point to create your own configuration.

json
yaml
toml
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json",
  "final_space": true,
  "version": 3,
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "alignment": "left",
      "segments": [
        {
          "type": "path",
          "style": "powerline",
          "powerline_symbol": "\uE0B0",
          "foreground": "#ffffff",
          "background": "#61AFEF",
          "properties": {
            "style": "folder"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

With this configuration, a single powerline segment is rendered that shows the name of the folder you're currently in. To set this configuration in combination with a Oh My Posh executable, use the --config flag to set a path to a file containing the above code. The --shell universal flag is used to print the prompt without escape characters to see the prompt as it would be shown inside a prompt function for your shell.

caution
The command below will not persist the configuration for your shell but print the prompt in your terminal. If you want to use your own configuration permanently, adjust the prompt configuration to use your custom configuration.

oh-my-posh print primary --config sample.json --shell uni

If all goes according to plan, you should see the prompt being printed out on the line below. In case you see a lot of boxes with question marks, set up your terminal to use a supported font before continuing.

tip
The --config flag can accept either a local filepath or a remotely hosted config file.

For example, the following is a valid --config flag: --config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/jandedobbeleer.omp.json'

{
  "maps": {
    "user_name": {
      "jan": "ðŸš€",
      "root": "âš¡"
    },
    "host_name": {
      "laptop123": "work"
    }
  }
}

JSON Schema Validation
As mentioned above, Oh My Posh configurations can utilize JSON Schema to validate their contents. Configurations should include a link to the external schema document which prescribes the appropriate structure and contents for various elements. If your code editor is configured to use JSON Schema, it will compare your configuration to the external document, and issue warnings for discrepancies.

For example, given the following code:

...
"segments": [
  {
    "type": "an_invalid_entry",
    "template": "{{ if gt .Code 0 }}\uf134{{ end }}",
  }
]
...

Warnings will be raised for type, since an_invalid_entry is not in the list of acceptable values, as well as for the entire segment item (enclosed in {}), since it lacks the required style key. Take advantage of these warnings, and ignore them at your peril.

Accepted Formats
Oh My Posh supports three file formats for configurations: json, yaml, and toml.

Various converters exist to convert between these, although they aren't perfect and will require manual adjustment. Notably, the schema implementation for json is as follows:

{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json"
}

While for yaml:

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/main/themes/schema.json


Converters won't catch this change, so you will need to adjust manually.
